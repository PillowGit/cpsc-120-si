# Header files

We are now going to demonstrate using a header file!

Reuse your function from `task-1` in this file.

**Note:** Files ending in `.h` and `.hpp` are header files for C++. `.h` is used for C but works for C++ code as well, while `.hpp` is used for C++ code only.

## Tasks:

1. Move the `PrintString` function from task-1 into the header file declared here
2. Include the header file in the main file
3. Ask the user for a string to print
4. Call the function with the user's input
5. Test your code with `./run.sh`
