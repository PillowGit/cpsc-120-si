# Header files

We are now going to demonstrate using a header file!

Reuse your function from `task-1` in this file.

## Tasks:

1. Move the `PrintString` function from task-1 into the header file declared here
2. Include the header file in the main file
3. Ask the user for a string to print
4. Call the function with the user's input
5. Test your code with `./run.sh`
