# Header files

We are now going to demonstrate using a header file!

Reuse your function from `task-1` in this file.

## Tasks:

1. Move the `PrintString` function from task-1 into the header file here
2. Include the header file in the main file
3. Call the function in the main file with any string you'd like
4. Test your code with `run.sh`
