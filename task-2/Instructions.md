## User Filled Vector

In this file, we will practice a lot of techniques from previous lectures. This includes user input, if statements, and using booleans

### Tasks:

1. Include the vector and string headers from the standard library
2. Create a vector with the initialization strategy we have been using for all of our variables, but make it empty this time
3. Create 3 empty strings to store user input
4. Take user input 3 times for your strings
5. Use `vector::push_back()` to push the strings into the vector
6. Check if the vector has a certain name using the `funcs.hpp` function, `HasName()`
7. Use `./run.sh` to check your results!
