### Print by Reference

In this file we will practice passing a variable by reference, and understanding it's importance.

## Tasks:

1. Open the `main.cpp` file
2. Write a function named `PrintString` that demonstrates passing a variable (a string) by reference

- This function should print the string, then clear the contents

3. Use `cout` and `cin` to ask the user for what to print
4. Ask for user input and call the function in `main.cpp`
5. Test your code (use `./run.sh`)
