## Make a vector

In this file we'll do basic practice with creating a vector

### Tasks:

1. Include the vector header from the standard library
2. Create a vector with the initialization strategy we have been using for all of our variables
3. Use the `PrintVector` function (comes from funcs.hpp) to view your vector
4. Use `./run.sh` to view your vector, experiment around with it a bit!
