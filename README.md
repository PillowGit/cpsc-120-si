Link - https://github.com/PillowGit/cpsc-120-si/tree/7b177ed6ea85b6261b7e60203d12a5a5f55c2c72

Description - Goes over using cin/cout basics, using if statements, and a brief description of header files. Things like how do we use them, why do we use them, what source files are, etc.

## [If statements & type casting practice](https://github.com/PillowGit/cpsc-120-si/tree/d265846da78e66db83678b2c4001cbaf7f89e2b1)

Description - These activites demonstrate comparing high precision decimal values with if-statements, how to structure your if-statements so they are readable and make sense, and how we can use type-casting to our advantage.

## [std::vector practice](https://github.com/PillowGit/cpsc-120-si/tree/418eb24e100f4130b229835790ba1a16f646ba61)
