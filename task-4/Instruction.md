# else-if statements

In this last task, we are going to demonstrate a simple if statement (and some practice using headers)

```cpp
bool condition = 5 > 20;

if (condition) {
  std::cout << "This is true.";
} else {
  std::cout << "This is false.";
}
```

## Tasks:

1. Read `helper-functions.hpp` to understand the function we are given
2. Fill out the main function with the TODO comments we're given
3. Test your code using `./run.sh`
