## Vector Methods Practice

In this file, we will practice using the following vector methods:

* vector::size()
* vector::at()
* vector::front()
* vector::push_back()
* vector::back()
* vector::clear()

### Tasks:

1. Complete the tasks in the comments in `main.cpp`
* Refer to [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JIh5_cI39tFIq6x-rPEdq04ZcWDMslhJC-1fE6-KPos/edit#slide=id.g26b48127497_3_1639) or [cpp-reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) to help you out
2. Use `./run.sh` to test your code!
